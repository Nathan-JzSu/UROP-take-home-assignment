This is private repo for BU UROP program assignment

Hello Swapneel Sundeep Mehta!

This is my take-home assignment repo, private as you mentioned

I modified three files: 
    consumer_producer_marketplace\server\src\callbacks.js
    consumer_producer_marketplace\client\src\stages\SelectRoleStage.jsx

I learned how titfortat strategy codes, and I write "nocheat2" strategy based on that
In callbacks.js, I added the logic that once the player cheats in first 2 rounds, players can't sell any products, otherwise player sells at much as consumers' capacity
In SelectRoleStage.js, I added the type of strategy "NoCheat2" into the selection table so you can click it to test my code.

TEST INFO:
    cd consumer_producer_marketplace
    empirica

I'm sorry I didn't do bonus tasks due to my limited time this week. I spent a lot of time on CS350 and another mid-term.
That's why I asked you for extension of this assignment.
